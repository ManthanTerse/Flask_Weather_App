# 🌦️ Flask Weather App
 - Because even Python 🐍 needs to check the weather before going out...
This is a simple weather web app built using **Python + Flask** that allows users to check the real-time weather of any city by entering its name. It fetches data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays temperature, humidity, weather condition, and an icon using a clean HTML interface.
